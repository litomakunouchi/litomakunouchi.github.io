            For the past three years, the vibrant city of Manila has been my home. My roots, however, are firmly planted in Samar, where I spent my formative years. My journey also led me to Cebu, where I dedicated several years to work and study.

            I look forward to spending some time in Davao (possibly on remote work) which would mean I would have lived to 3 major islands in the Philippines- Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao.

            On Sundays, I love to hangout near Betty-Go Belmonte, New Manila.

            While my current residence has a strict “no pets” policy, it doesn’t stop me from showing some love to our furry friends. I have taken on the role of the unofficial neighborhood cat feeder and dog whisperer. When the dogs get a bit too rowdy and their barks threaten to disrupt my calls, I step in to restore peace and quiet. It’s all in a day’s work!
